# React-ATM

## Description

This repository is an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) application built with **React**. The application allows a user to deposit or withdraw cash and updates the account balance after each transaction. It provides a stylized interface with transaction validation, error handling, and sound effects using the dingSound audio file through the **React** Hook useRef. The fox logo was generated using **MidJourney**.
The Account.js component manages the state and functionality of the ATM account, including depositing or withdrawing cash, handling transaction validation, and displaying error messages. The ATMDeposit.js component renders the deposit interface, allowing users to input the desired amount and triggering the sound effect upon submission. The number input field clears after the user submits their deposit. The Header.js component displays the application logo, title, and a welcome message.
